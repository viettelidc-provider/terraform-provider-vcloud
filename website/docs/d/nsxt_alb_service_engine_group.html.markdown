  Provides a data source to read ALB Service Engine Groups. A Service Engine Group is an isolation domain that also
  defines shared service engine properties, such as size, network access, and failover. Resources in a service engine
  group can be used for different virtual services, depending on your tenant needs. These resources cannot be shared
  between different service engine groups.

  sync_on_refresh = false
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required)  - Name of Service Engine Group.
* `sync_on_refresh` - (Optional) - A special argument that is not passed to VCLOUD, but alters behaviour of this resource so
  that it performs a Sync operation on every Terraform refresh. *Note* this may impact refresh performance, but should
  ensure up-to-date information is read. Default is **false**.

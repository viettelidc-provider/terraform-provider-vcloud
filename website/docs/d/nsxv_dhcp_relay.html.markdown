# vcloud\_nsxv\_dhcp\_relay

Provides a Viettel IDC Cloud Edge Gateway DHCP relay configuration data source. The DHCP relay
capability provided by NSX in Viettel IDC Cloud environment allows to leverage existing DHCP
infrastructure from within Viettel IDC Cloud environment without any interruption to the IP address
management in existing DHCP infrastructure. DHCP messages are relayed from virtual machines to the
designated DHCP servers in your physical DHCP infrastructure, which allows IP addresses controlled
by the NSX software to continue to be in sync with IP addresses in the rest of your DHCP-controlled
environments.
